# The latest version of rustful in crates.io is 0.9.0, this
# eventually depends on openssl-sys v0.7.17. However reqwest
# eventually depends on openssl-sys v0.9.25, and we can only

# The current version of rustful at HEAD from github.com
# resolves this dependency, but hasn't been released to crates.
