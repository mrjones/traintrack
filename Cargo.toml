# The latest version of rustful in crates.io is 0.9.0, this
# eventually depends on openssl-sys v0.7.17. However reqwest
# eventually depends on openssl-sys v0.9.25, and we can only
# link against one version.
# The current version of rustful at HEAD from github.com
# resolves this dependency, but hasn't been released to crates.
# TODO(mrjones): Return to crates version of rustful when possible.
